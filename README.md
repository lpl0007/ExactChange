# Exact Change
## Problem Overview
+ User can input any amount of money
  + Up to 2 decimal places
  + U.S. currency
+ Application returns the least amount of change possible

## How To Set Up
+ Upload ExactChange.java to an IDE that supports java
  + I have used jGRASP, other IDEs may not work the same way
+ Save and compile

## How To Use
+ Simply input the amount you want broken up in just numbers (Ex. 19.99 instead of $19.99)
  + The application will return the change in a combination of $100, $50, $20, $10, $5, $1, quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies.

## Notes
+ Assumed the $2 bill and 50 cent coin were not included in change
